# JavaNEAT

This is an implementation of the neuro-evolutionary algorithm "NEAT" that I wrote in Java. I worte it to be as flexible as possible, so it can be used for a wide variety of projects. I encourage users to write their own DataPanel subclasses to view and track the data they're interested in as the algorithm runs!
